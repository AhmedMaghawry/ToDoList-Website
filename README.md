# ToDoList-Website
Our code is divided into 3 clusters:
a)	HTML: which controls the main static printings of the frame of the page.
b)	CSS: which is responsible for the stylish look of the web page. (Such as the Date Picker, table Styles, spans, etc.)
c)	JavaScript & JQuery: it controls the dynamic actions in the web page. (Such as the showing of All Tasks tables and the form of submitting new Tasks)

It uses NodeJS for Backend developing and a server to test the project.
The Users' Data saves as saving the whole pags as Html then load when use, Using this method because it isn't allowed in this project to use any php programming.
